# The Lamb

The Lamb is a poem by William Blake, published in Songs of Innocence in 1789.

It has a counterpart in Songs of Experience: the poem "The Tyger", which describes the fury and power of this animal as opposed to the mildness of the lamb, though wondering if their creator is the same.

The Lamb and the Tiger symbolize two contrary states of the human mind: an innocent one, featured in the early stages of life, and a corrupted on, spoiled by the evil experienced during the years.
